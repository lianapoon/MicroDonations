# MicroDonations Project-2-18
This is a project created in the 2020 Fall semester for UVA's CS 3240 Advanced Software Developement Techniques as assigned by Professor Mark Sherriff and Professor Will McBurnery. The theme selected for this project was Inclusion and Diversity in Software Development. The subtopic chosen within that theme is a MicroDonations app. Holistically the app supports the ability to post, view, and complete donations and tasks added by different users and the tasks donations they may choose to represent. 

You can find the site hosted on Heroku at https://micro-donations-cs3240.herokuapp.com/

## Donation Page
### Overview of Donation Card
The donation holds the entire list of organizations that are available to donate to. These can be both larger charities or smaller coordinated efforts to raise money for a local supported cause. You can view the goal and progress bar to see the status of each donation goal (Note that you can donate even when the donation bar is full or the goal will be surpassed by your donation. The charities will always appreciate your overwhelming support :) ). 
### Donating
To donate click the donate button and you will be redirected to a page where you can input the desired amount you want to the organization. When you have the desired amount you wanted, click the PayPal pay now button to log into your account. Once logged in feel free to verify the amount that will be donated then when you are ready scroll down to the pay now button to confirm your donation.

*Important note about donating*
The steps above are implemented using PayPal's sandbox API. For the purpose of this project we are not running a legitimate business or charity and do not want and do not expect users or others testing the software to spend their own real money. Because setting up a sandbox account is inconvinient for the user we have set up an account with information that you can use to test and use the donating functionality
